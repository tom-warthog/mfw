    <header>
        <h1>This is a mother fucking website.</h1>
        <aside>And it's fucking perfect.</aside>
    </header>

        <h2>Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?</h2>
        <p>You probably build wesites and think your shit is special.
You think your 13 megabyte parrallax-active home page is going to get
you some fucking awwward banner you can glue to the top of your site.
You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner
because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, motherfucker.
Let me describe your perfect-ass website :</p></br>
        <ul>
            <li>Shit's lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li>Fits on all your shitty screens</li>
            <li>Looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
            <li>The motherfucker's accessible to every asshole that visits you site</li></br>

        <h3>Well guess what, motherfucker :</h3></br>
        <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a motherfucking website.
Why the fuck do you need to animate a fucking trendy-ass banner flag when i
hover over that useless piece of shit? You spend hours on it and added 80
kilobytes to your fucking site, and some motherfucker jabbing at
it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that shit. Not
to mention blind people will never see that shit, but they don't see any
of your shitty shit.<br/>
You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.<br/>

        <h2>It's fucking lightweight</h2><br/>
        <p>This entire page weights less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your fucking
Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could
animate the fucking background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces
of a shitty webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the begining
of your site? You pieace of shit.</P></br>

        <h2>It's responsive</h2></br>
        <p>You dumbass. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no.
Responsive means that it respond to whatever motherfucking screensize it's viewed on.
This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a motherfucking Tamagotchi.</p></br>

        <h2>It fucking works</h2></br>
        <P>Look at this shit. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, motherfucker.
It makes sense. It has motherfucking hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you
and your bitch-ass browser know what the fuck's in this fucking site. That's semantics,
motherfucker.<br>
It has content on the fucking screen. Your site has three bylines
and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and
make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.<br>
Cross-browser compatibility? Load this motherfucker in IE6. I fucking dare you.</p></br>

        <h2>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h2></br>
        <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural
state is, you have no fucking idea what a website is. All you have ever seen
are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating
a fucking message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it.
It's fucking beautiful.</p></br>

        <h3>Yes, this is fucking satire, you fuck</h3></br>
        <p>I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like this. What I'm saying
is that all the problems we have with websites are <strong>ones we create ourselves.</strong>
Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible.
You break them. You son-of-a-bitch.</p></br>

            From the philosophies expressed (poorly) above, txti was created.
